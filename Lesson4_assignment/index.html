<h1> How Technology Can Help, and Hurt, the Environment </h1>

<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

<p>
    The Industrial Revolution marked a major push forward in human technology.  This was a time period in which a change was made from agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and manufacturing.  The process began in Britain and quickly began to spread to the rest of the world.  This jump in technology made many people's lives easier and mass industry much more accessible.  By the late 18th century and early 19th century, coal came into large-scale use.  This quickly resulted in a soot and smog covering major urban centers.  Acid rain, first discovered in the 1850s, was a terrible phenomenon resulting in the coal-powered factories and plants. In 1948, severe industrial air pollution in Pennsylvania created a deathly smog that affected over 7,000 people, killing at least 20.

    Today, technology has made major advancements since the Industrial Revolution resulting in much easier standard of living, as well as major pollution in the world.  Greenhouse gases trap heat inside the atmosphere and make the planet htoter.  Human activities are responsible for almost all of the in greenhouse gases in the amtmosphere over the last 150 years.  According to a 2016 study by the Environmental Protection Agency, electricity and industry make up about 50% of total carbon emissions with transportation making up another 28%.  
</p>
<p>
    Since the late 19th century, the planet's average temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit.  Most of the warming has happened in the last 35 years, with the warmest years on record taking place after 2010.  Because of this global warming, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass.  Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 281 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 119 billion tons during the same time period.  This ice sheet melting leads to a rise in sea levels.  Global sea level has risen about 8 inches in the last century, but the rate in the last two centuries has nearly doubled, with the levels rising slightly more every year.

    Over the past few years, advancments have been made to try and slow down and reverse climate change.  According to The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, electric vehicles can drastically help clean the environment, with transportation contributing to 28% of carbon emissions.  All-electric vehicles produce zero direct emissions which directly help improve air quality in major urban areas. Just as technology has lead to global warming and climate change, technology can directly slow down and eventually reverse it.  When funds are directed towards this technology, the entire world benefits.
